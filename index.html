<h1>Yesterday</h1>
Yesterday,<br>
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.<br>
Now my database has gone away.<br>
Oh I believe in yesterday.<br>
</p>

<p>
Suddenly,<br>
There's not half the files there used to be,<br>
And there's a milestone hanging over me.<br>
The system crashed so suddenly.<br>
</p>

<p>
I pushed somehting wrong,<br>
What it was I could not say.<br>
Now all my data's gone<br>
And I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.<br>
</p>

<p>
Yesterday,<br>
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.<br>
I knew my data was all here to stay,<br>
Now I believe in yesterday,<br>
